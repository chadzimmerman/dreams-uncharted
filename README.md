## 🚀 Project Overview
Dreams Uncharted is a specialized e-commerce and crowdfunding platform designed to ensure authors and comic artists are fairly compensated for their work. 

I took over a not-quite-functional PHP/MySQL codebase in November 2025. Since then, I have re-architected the platform into a fully automated passive-income engine that supports 15+ active creators and has increased artist revenue by thousands of dollars annually.

## 🛠 Key Features & My Contributions

### 1. Automated "Goal-Based" Content Release
I engineered a logic system where comics are released incrementally. 
* **The Logic:** Artists upload chapters in advance. Once a community donation goal is met, the system automatically triggers the publication of the next set of pages.
* **The Result:** Zero manual intervention required for content rollout once the goal is hit.

### 2. Complex Financial Automation (PayPal Integration)
I developed a custom payment split logic to handle transparent and immediate distributions. Every single donation is automatically routed at the point of sale:
* **95%** to the Author
* **3%** to Monarch Cyber Solutions (IT)
* **2%** to Dreams (Platform Owner)
* **Impact:** This eliminated manual accounting and ensured creators are paid instantly.

### 3. Secure Multi-Tenant Backend & RBAC
Originally, the site only supported Admin logins. I rebuilt the authentication layer to support **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
* **Artist Portal:** A dynamic dashboard that filters the database to show *only* that specific artist's comics, stats, and earnings.
* **Scalability:** The system is now architected to support future roles, such as "Publishers," with their own unique permissions.

### 4. Systems Administration
As the SysAdmin since late 2025, I manage the deployment, database integrity, and security of the PHP/MySQL environment, ensuring 100% uptime for our creators.
